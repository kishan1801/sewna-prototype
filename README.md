## What I built

- Welcome page (role CTAs)
- Designer Discovery: search, tag filters, saved favorites, skeleton loaders, toasts
- Designer Profile modal + full profile page
- Designer Dashboard: profile editor, portfolio upload (client-side), publish/unpublish to Discovery (localStorage)
- Image compression + limits to avoid localStorage quota issues
- Responsive layout and accessible micro-interactions
